Please check the question test cases for the Umbrella problem, I wrote the solution and 9/12 test cases passed. Test Cases 4 & 10 were hidden so was not able to debug but Test Case 5 had the input as 10 people and sizes as 2,3,6,5 so the number of umbrellas required would be 3 to fit exact 10 people which my solution gave the output but the expected output was 2 which is clearly wrong. Please check on this Test Case 5 as well as the hidden test cases.

you should explore new projects, again bnym not good, management polictics is high in bnym nowadays and they put a lot of pressure for work and  micro management can also happen in some cases, so we have to be very careful, they give more work and burden to vendors and strict timelines
