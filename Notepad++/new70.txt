quality attributes, cost effective, time to market

frontend, backend both -- newer selections reasons

TCO budget present and design one

deployment architecture, hardware, netwoekr, software, -- total all

futuristic long time solutions and value adds

Existing Application Functionalities - not mentioned

PPT- 2 PARTS
AS IS DESIGN, 
TO BE DESIGN - BLOCK DIAGRAM, FLOW, UI SCREENSHOTS, ALL IMPLEMENTATIONS


ASK NIRUPAM FOR THIS

PREPARE ALL THE DOCUMENTS

WHY USING THE TECHNOLOGIES/AWS COMPONENTS
CHOOSE 3 ALTERNATIVES
DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY & DEPLOYMENT VIEW

SOFTWARES REQUIRED FOR LINUX SERVER


FUNACTIONAL/NON FUNCTIONS REQUIREMENTS
SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
USE CASE DIAGRAMS
NETWORK/DEPLOYMENT DIAGRAMS
TOOLS & TECHNOLOGIES
SEQUENCE/CLASS Diagrams/USE CASE DIAGRAMS
HLD ARCHITECTURE
ARCHITECTURE FEATURES
BENEFITS/ADVANTAGES
TCO IF DONE to hightlight


CONS-PREPARE/WEAKNESSES/PREVENTION, CROSS CUTTING CONCERNS


CHECK FOR THE BEST LINUX INSTANCE WHILE EVALUATION, BETTER LINUX INSTANCE for APP UPGRADE, TCO FOR LONG YEARS, GIVE MORE PICTURE THAN TEXT IN PPT

very good presentation, you covered most of the things, good tco, unique case study full technical
