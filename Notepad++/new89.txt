more technical side, then will shift you from the current project and if usa, you want to go, then you have to stay in current project only
sai project is only discussions, there is no work going on and you will get bored
for pso project, if you move then coming back again, it will be tough
i can move you to another project within digital of truist
one person was suppose to go onsite in sept but resigned in august as he got good pay package compared to onsite so think accodingly and decide
situation is volatile in usa, students scenario see, and other cases
also savings wise we have to check and decide, only roaming usa is not the case
so if you want to go onsite, you have to stay in current project and you will replace avesh and handle ui at oniste
if no onsite, then let me know and i will move you to another project and replace you
as per my thought process, i am more good in startup and new orgs, service company wont suit me
