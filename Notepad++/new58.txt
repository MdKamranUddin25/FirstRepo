Migrate an on-premises Go web application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk by using the binary method

rehost given by aws

replatform as an alternate

Using this migration strategy, you move the application to the cloud, and you introduce some level of optimization in order to operate the application efficiently, to reduce costs, or to take advantage of cloud capabilities

You want to improve your security and compliance stance by upgrading your operating system to the latest version.

You can reduce costs by using AWS Graviton Processors, custom-built processors developed by AWS

You can improve performance by migrating virtual machines into containers, without making any code changes. You can modernize your .NET and Java applications into containerized applications by using the AWS App2Container migration tool.

Replatform reduces cost and improves performance by migrating to a managed or serverless service, moving virtual machines to container, and avoiding licensing expenses.
